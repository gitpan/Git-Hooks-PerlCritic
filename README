NAME
    Git::Hooks::PerlCritic - Perl Critic hooks for git

VERSION
    version 0.001000

DESCRIPTION
    Allows you to utilize Perl::Critic via git hooks
    <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/githooks.html> using
    the Git::Hooks framework.

    First setup git-hooks.pl

    Then you should choose to use only one of the available hooks.

HOOKS
  pre-commit
            ln -s git-hooks.pl pre-commit
            git config --add githooks.pre-commit PerlCritic

    This hook will prevent a commit that doesn't pass Perl::Critic from
    being committed.

  prepare-commit-msg
            ln -s git-hooks.pl prepare-commit-msg
            git config --add githooks.preprare-commit-msg PerlCritic

    This hook will simply append commented out critic warnings to the commit
    message, so you may review them before committing. Note: requires
    Path::Class::File.
